I'm not sure if "Tsunami" is a good name. But I need your opinion. 

Hello. I am a Japanese engineer.

I am not claiming this is bad, you must change the name, or anything like that.
I opened this issue to ask opinions to y'all.

I am not SUPER familiar with the recent "wording" issues around protests so I apologize in advance but I wonder if you ever discussed this is a good naming.

Japan and some countries have had a huge earth quake, which brought a huge tsunami afterwards. The impact those gave still remains at the disaster area. Even though I am not one of the victim, I felt like I have to ask this, but I don't want to make any drama so if you want to close this issue you can, but at least I would like some opinions from the OSS team.

Thanks,
