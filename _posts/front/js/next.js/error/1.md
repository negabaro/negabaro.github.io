For my case, I just remove node_modules and package-lock.json and run npm install again, Its works. Related #6167

For me this was fixed by upgrading @babel/core:

-        "@babel/core": "^7.1.0",
+        "@babel/core": "7.2.2",
For some reason we have that as direct dependency currently.

I fixed it by updating my webpack via yarn add webpack@latest

I just removed webpack altogether and it started working.

Did you have it in your dependencies or devDependencies, if so, why'd you add it? I'm really curious about that because I've seen users do that before and I'm still not sure why and it's potentially breaking in many ways
