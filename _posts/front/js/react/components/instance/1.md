important point is that ReactComponents (as described in React’s documentation) refer to an instance of a React component class.

If you’re familiar with JavaScript, you’re probably thinking the “new” operator when you hear the phrase “instance of a class” and your intuition is correct.

However, you never use the “new” operator to create React Components.

Instead, you’ll use `ReactDOM.render()` to render a React Element into a particular DOM element, and the `return value of ReactDOM.render()` will be the `React Component instance.`

The component instance returned from ReactDOM.render() can call methods defined in the React Component class. This makes sense if you take a step back and remember that ReactDOM.render() is just React’s way of instantiating a Component for you
