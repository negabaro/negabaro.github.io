Prisma는 DB 프록시이다. GraphQL 개발자와 Heroku 창업자가 같이 진행 중인 프로젝트라고 한다. GraphQL 스키마를 기반으로 DB를 자동으로 생성해준다.

GraphCool was renamed Prisma, they are the same thing.
-> I think Prisma is the engine that graphcool uses, which they open sourced. Graphcool is the full service I think.

Looking into it made me even more confused about the whole thing for a while. You are right. For anybody else there is some good info here about the differences between the two.
